PokéCaféReMix last digit bingo helper

(images and synopsis to describe what we're talkin about)
(tooltips and alt text to describe 1MC and SC options)


 Mode: ( ) 1MC ( ) SC
 Have premium pass? ( ) Yes ( ) No
 Digits needed for bingo:
 [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]

 *Button1


where the label of Button1 depends on the mode:
"Start" or "To stage 1"
and Button1 is greyed until this form validates


Upon clicking Button1:
If the digit 0 is selected, show an alert on how to do it easily.
Else if 1MC is selected, load this form:

 [<- Back]
 <div class='infotip'>
 When entering scores, only the last $ digits are required.
 Make sure to remove all megaphones and honey before entering scores!
 </div>
 Current score: *Number2
 If you quit now, the final score will end in $.


(placing a keystroke handler on the number field to filter out non-digit characters and update the form in real time)


Else if SC is selected, load this form:
 [<- Back]
 <div class='infotip'>
 When entering scores, only the last *X digits are required.
 </div>
 Score from stage $: *Number1
 Current score: *Number2
 If you quit now, the final score will end in $.
 [To stage $]

(again, placing a keystroke handler on the number fields but also a click handler on the "To stage" button)


Anyway, what do we do with Number2? What kind of feedback does the user want?
I have one idea that could work:

   Autosuggest based on the digits entered (from left to right)

When a digit is entered, check if there are any full number combinations that satisfy both the user input and the bingo number requirement.

If so, show all auto-suggested numbers sorted numerically, next to the
input field. This makes it easy to compare numbers against in-game score.

If not, show a red check mark.
